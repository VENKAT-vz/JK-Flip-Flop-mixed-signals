# JK-Flip-Flop-mixed-signals
Flip flops are the electronic devices which consists of two stable states.The flip flops are the fundamental building<br />
blocks in digital electronics systems.These are sequential circuits since the output depends on both present input and <br />
past output.These circuits are basic memory storage elements.There are different kinds of flip flops,like SR flip flop,<br />
JK flip flop,D flip flop and T flip flop.The input and output to a JK flip flop are digital signals but the main aim <br />
here is to design and simulate JK flip flop using mixed signals i.e. by using both analog and digital signals.<br />

### 4. Circuit Details
The JK flip flop was invented by Jack Kilby and hence the name JK flip flop.It is the most widely used flip flop.<br />
This flipflop is also called as universal flip flop.The sequential operation of JK flip flop is same as that of<br />
SR flip flop Except that the JK flip flop does not allow the invalid input state in which both the inputs are 0.<br />
<br />
The basic SR flip flop suffers from the following two problems:<br />
i)First, the condition S=R=0 must be avoided.<br />
ii)second,if the state of S or R changes its state while the input which is enabled is high, the correct latching<br />
action does not occur.<br />
<br />
Thus, to overcome these two drawbacks,JK flip flop was invented.<br />
The design of JK flip flop is same as that of SR flip flop but consists of a clock,two input AND gates are replaced <br />
by two 3-input NAND gates.Here J=S and K=R and with the third input of each NAND gate connected to the outputs at Q and Qbar.<br />
The cross-coupling of the SR flip-flop permits the previous invalid condition of S=R=1 to be used to produce the toggle action as the two inputs are now interlocked.<br />
<br />
At the input side of jk flip flop we use analog to digital converter(adc_bridge) and at the output side we use a digital to
analog converter(dac_bridge).In this way we can design JK flip flop in mixed signals.<br />
<br />
